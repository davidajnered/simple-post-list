== Description ==

This widget lets you create a push for any post you like. It can create two kinds of pushes, both dynamic and static ones. A dynamic push is a push that shows the latest post from a category you select. It will automatically update it for you. To create a dynamic push simply select a category from the category drop down.To create a static push you select the post you want to show from the post drop down instead. This push will never change unless you reconfigure the widget.
